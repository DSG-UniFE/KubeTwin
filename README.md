#Â A Simulator for IT Service in Federated Clouds (SISFC)

SISFC is a simulator designed to reenact the behaviour of IT services in
federated Cloud environments.


## References

This simulator (more precisely an earlier version of it) was used in the
following research papers:

1.  L. Foschini, M. Tortonesi, "Adaptive and Business-driven Service Placement
    in Federated Cloud Computing Environments", in Proceedings of the 8th
    IFIP/IEEE International Workshop on Business-driven IT Management (BDIM 2013),
    27 May 2013, Ghent, Belgium.

    Component Placement for Complex Services in Federated Clouds", to appear in
    Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium
    (NOMS 2014) - Mini-conference track, 5-9 May 2014, Krakow, Poland.

Please, consider citing some of these papers if you find this simulator useful
for your research.


## Installation

You can install the SISFC simulator through RubyGems:

    gem install sisfc

While SISFC should work on MRI and Rubinius without problems, we highly
recommend you to run it on top of JRuby. Since JRuby is our reference
development platform, you will be very likely to have a smoother installation
and usage experience when deploying SISFC on top of JRuby.


## Usage

To run the simulator, simply digit:

    sisfc simulator.conf vm_allocation.conf

where simulator.conf and vm\_allocation.conf are your simulation environment
and vm allocation configuration files respectively.

The examples directory contains a set of example configuration files, including
an [R](http://www.r-project.org) script that models a stochastic request
generation process. To use that script, you will need R with the VGAM and
truncnorm packages installed.

Note that the SISFC was not designed to be run directly by users, but instead
to be integrated within automated tools that implement a continuous
optimization framework (for instance, built on top of our [mhl metaheuristics
library](https://github.com/mtortonesi/ruby-mhl)).
